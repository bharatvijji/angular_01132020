Exercise 3

1. Create a color form in the HTML template. In the color form, one input element should created to capture the name of a new color. Be sure to wire the input and label, etc... Use the Reactive Form object model we created the demo to connect the HTML form to the component model.

2. Add button to the form. When the button is clicked, take the collected form data and create a new color object. Using immutable programming techniques add the color to the array of colors to update the color list.

3. Reset the form after the color is added.

4. Ensure it works.
