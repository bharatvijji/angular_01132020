1. Move the car form to its own component following the pattern we did for color tool. Be sure to setup an input for the button text.

2. Add a Delete button to the Car Table on each row. When the button is clicked, remove the row from the table.

Hint: 
<li *ngFor="let color of colors>
  {{color.name}}

  <button (click)="doSomething(color.id)">Do Something</button>
</li>
